(<a href=\"https://www.meteor.com\">https://www.meteor.com</a>)</p>\n<p>Why i moved to <strong>Meteor.js</strong> ?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Metoer</strong></em> is using DDP, the Distributed Data _Protocol , why ? _</p>\n<p><strong>DDP</strong> is a simple <em>protocol</em> for fetching structured data from a server, and receiving live updates when that data changes.</p>\n<p>Still don’t get it ? Meteor synchronise your data (mongodb collections …)  between the server and the client and it handle everything by itself.</p>\n<p>** Socket.io** Meteor use socket.io than Http requests and all of us know that socket.io is so much faster than Http requests.</p>\n<p><strong>Meteor.<strong><strong>i</strong></strong>sServer</strong> <strong>and</strong>** Me****teor.**<strong>isClient</strong>,__ you will use this if you will build one file app, in the same file you can define wich code will run on server and wich code will run on the client, and there’s other ways relieve you from using this method.__</p>\n<p><strong>Structure</strong> with Meteor  you can define your file structure, you can use one file to build your app or use known folders name, Ok how? when we create a <strong>client</strong> folder, Meteor will considaret that all file in this folder belongs to the client, also with the server, when we create a s<strong>erver</strong> folder Meteor will considaret that all file in this folder belongs to the server.</p>\n<p><strong>Collections</strong> Metoer use Schema to define collections, when you put them in a folder named **collections  **Meteor will run these files on both side, on the server and the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Atmospherejs</strong> Metoer has a greet community that already built a banch modules that let you kicksatrt your project,</p>\n<p>these module are hosted on <a href=\"http://atmospherejs.com\">atmospherejs.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Meteor is much more richer than you think and you can build and maintain scalable web and mobile applications with it.<img src=\"http://aymen.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/meteor-300x187.png\" alt=\"meteor\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mean.io it’s been good to know you, i’m moving to Meteor.js","date":"March 29, 2016","description":null,"categories":["thoughts"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/node-js-events/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Node.js Events"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/jobs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jobs"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ba9e98a2-70c1-5b2e-86ca-2ab3302ac312","previousPostId":"cc31042c-0853-542f-bc83-1cda5552734b","nextPostId":"49db2d31-4b41-582c-aced-b1f1ccd1c821","category":"thoughts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
