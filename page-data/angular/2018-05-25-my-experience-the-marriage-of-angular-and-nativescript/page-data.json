I moved on and I found <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\"><strong>ReactNative</strong></a> And <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a>, I choose the second because I’m an <strong>Angular</strong> developer.</p>\n<p><strong>Initially</strong>, NativeScript lets developer create Native <strong>mobile views</strong> and using Javascript as <strong>Code behind</strong>, then They introduced building apps with Angular, which helps the Angular developer to give a try the mobile development.</p>\n<p><strong>Personally</strong>, I didn’t try NativeScript with Angular.js, the first app I’ve Made is with <strong>Angular2+</strong>.</p>\n<p>As I mention the <strong>layout rendering</strong> is Good and fluid, but I’ve got some complication when using Nativescript:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Garbage Collector (Android Only)</strong></p>\n<p>We all know that <strong>Angular output</strong> is quite big than a plain Javascript app. when exploring the app that I’ve made, I experience a random UI freeze, and it’s remarkable and it affected the user experience.</p>\n<p>After an Investigation, I found that the JavaScript GC(Garbage Collector) triggered when no more RAM is available and that causes the freeze ( from 0.5s to 2ssecondsd on Angular). After many issues opened on Github <a href=\"https://github.com/PanayotCankov\">Panayot Cankov</a> wrote a blog (<a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/blog/deep-dive-into-nativescript-3.1-performance-improvements\">Deep Dive into NativeScript 3.1 Performance Improvements</a> ) about performance and <strong>explained</strong> why and when this issue happens.</p>\n<p>Then in the <strong>announcement</strong> of NativeScript 3.2 (<a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/blog/announcing-the-release-of-nativescript-3.2\">Announcing the Release of NativeScript 3.2</a>) they introduce an experimental flag <code class=\"language-text\">\"markingMode\": \"none\"</code> for Android, I Tired and the freezes are gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch Time</strong></p>\n<p>Using Angular with NativeScript will affect the launch time <strong>especially on Android</strong>, and it will take longer than <strong><a href=\"http://vanilla-js.com/\">Vanilla Javascript</a></strong> .</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\"><strong>Webpack</strong></a> to <strong>minify and uglify</strong> speed up the App, but when I tried the <strong>Snapshot</strong> flag(Just for Android) I felt the difference.</p>\n<p>So what’s <a href=\"https://v8project.blogspot.bg/2015/09/custom-startup-snapshots.html\"><strong>Snapshot</strong></a>?</p>\n<p>It’s a <strong>previously prepared</strong> JavaScript <strong>context</strong>. Instead of fetching, parsing, and executing scripts on every startup, the NativeScript <em><strong>Android runtime</strong></em> looks for a previously prepared binary file that is the result of those tasks, to reduce the amount of time it takes for your app <strong>to get up and running</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Angular 2+</strong></em> is very structured and it <em>has <strong>clean Architecture patterns</strong></em> and it helps you build a <em><strong>scalable application</strong></em> without <strong>struggling.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>I found that <strong>NativeScript and Angular is a successful marriage</strong> and I hope it continues.</p>\n<p>Other <strong>opinions</strong>? leave a comment.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[My experience] The marriage of Angular and NativeScript","date":"May 25, 2018","description":null,"cover":"../images/angular-nativescript-aymen.co_.png"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-05-23-node-js-v10-what-you-need-to-know/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Node.js v10 What you need to know"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-07-29-docker-where-have-you-been/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Docker, where have you been ?"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"518b3ac2-40f0-5e3a-95fb-b6b29e3043bb","previousPostId":"e9c10157-e178-5876-8867-20fe71720293","nextPostId":"aa92e91f-779e-5828-af3b-ace88a48d48d","category":"angular"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
