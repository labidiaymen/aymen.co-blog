So:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angular 4 might deprecate APIs from Angular 2, but not break them</li>\n<li>Angular 5 might only deprecate APIs from Angular 4, but not break them (might break APIs from Angular 2 though)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team has confirmed that Angular 4 will be a backwards compatible upgrade from Angular.</p>\n<p><strong>Can we use it for production?</strong></p>\n<p>It depend on the type of the project you have.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have any corrections you can pull a request on GitHub : <a href=\"https://github.com/labidiaymen/aymen.co/blob/master/javascript/angular-4-wheres-the-version-3-why-the-hurry.md\">Angular4 ?
