Reactnative &#x26; Xamarin</strong> and the other side has only <strong>Ionic,</strong> the first use Native UI like UILabel(iOS) TextView(Android) with single XML tag <a href=\"https://docs.nativescript.org/cookbook/ui/text-view\"><em>text-view</em></a> the other side use WebView (HTML input &#x26; tags) which make the first side much better and smoother for complex UI even hot performance for simple UI.</p>\n<p>And of course, I definitely choose native UI  over Web UI.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let’s talk about why I choose <strong>Nativescript</strong> and talk about my <strong>experience</strong>.</p>\n<p>Android &#x26; iOS, each mobile platform has its own ecosystem and offers completely different development tools and languages, in order to translate JavaScript code to the corresponding native APIs so they made a runtime for each platform, let’s call it <strong>the Bridge</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s take an example, if we want to use <a href=\"https://sentry.io/\">sentry.io</a> (Open-source error tracking) to track bugs on mobile devices in real-time, we can use this plugin <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-sentry.io\">npmjs.com/package/nativescript-sentry.io</a> which is hosted on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npmjs</a> and immediately we can start using it in Javascript or Typescript.</p>\n<p>So how this plugin made?</p>\n<p>This plugin adds some <strong>dependencies</strong> with Gradle in Android And CocoaPods in iOS, and with <strong>The bridge,</strong> we can immediately start using them in plain Javascript code without any tweaks,(<em><strong>that’s the main part</strong></em> why I love Nativescript over all other platforms/frameworks) then we have the implementations parts wich done with javascript, no other languages or skills required .</p>\n<h3><strong>My Experience</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The Garbage collector</strong>: I wrote two application with NativeScript one of them is in production right now, with iOS always works like charm but the Android version with google machine V8 I’ve got some lags, and that because the synchronisation between garbage collector of the JavaScript and the garbage collector of Java (GC), they announce a fix for that on the version 3.2 of Nativescript (<a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/blog/announcing-the-release-of-nativescript-3.2\">Announcing the Release of NativeScript 3.2 &#x26; New Experimental GC Mode for Android</a>), they add an experimental flag and it solves the lags for now.</p>\n<p><strong>Google maps:</strong> Also when I used Google maps plugin I had some issues, one of them is (Of course it works like a charm on iOS, I got the issue on Android) when you create a page that contains a Google map card and you enter to a child route (i’m using Angular with Nativescript) and you press back button the app crash, so I switch to MapBox.</p>\n<p>I started making plugins for Nativescript, you can follow them at <a href=\"https://github.com/labidiaymen\">Github.com/labidiaymen</a></p>\n<p>If you wanna contribute to this articles or to one of my plugins you can make a comment or you can reach me: labidi{at}aymen.co</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hybrid mobile framework - NativeScript, Ionic, ReactNative","date":"January 15, 2018","description":null,"categories":["angular","ionic","javascript","nativescript"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/why-nativescript/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why NativeScript ?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-nativescript-plugin-that-works-make-a-nativescript-plugin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A NativeScript plugin that works - Making a NativeScript plugin"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cdae1046-e385-5873-8de6-8accd333199f","previousPostId":"ff86ee2a-203e-5214-9d9e-08b96be4c468","nextPostId":"38daa9b8-5aa4-5543-8b20-b3fe5c21f0c1","category":"angular"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
