that’s when I start looking for alternatives solutions, in the meanwhile <strong>Gitlab</strong> introduce the Continuous Integration <strong>feature</strong>, and it’s for <strong>FREE</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now when I (or anyone else in the same repository ) push a commit, Gitlab will run the test, build and generate an APK file (for Android) for me and show me If there are issues white building.</p>\n<p>I will share with you how I’ve Done it.</p>\n<p>You can achieve this <strong>workflow</strong> by adding .gitlab-ci.yml</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/labidiaymen/27f0e2dd6f2de278ca68c550d89c78fb.js\"></script>\n<p>Let’s break this file down.</p>\n<p>First, we created a <strong>Job</strong>, then we pull a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> image that contains a fresh Installed version of <strong>Android</strong>.</p>\n<p>Then we installed the <strong>Node.js</strong>, after that, we installed NativeScript, updating the Android SDK and installing Node modules with <strong>NPM</strong>.</p>\n<p>When everything is done, we build the App with NativeScript CLI (command line tools).</p>\n<p>In the build process of NativeScript we pass by the unit tests, if there’s an error it will be thrown with an Exception.</p>\n<p>If there’s no error and everything is fine we will get our APK available to download, This all happens while you’re writing your code in peace, you didn’t stress your machine but you got visibilities about what’s gonna happen when you build for production.</p>\n<p><strong>Isn’t a big deal? how do you think?</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[DevOps] Build and Test  Nativescript Project with Gitlab-CI","date":"May 19, 2018","description":null,"cover":"../images/devops-gitlab-ci-nativescript-aymen.co_-2.png"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/redux-ngrx-vuex-the-one-state-ideology/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[Redux, NGRX, VUEX] The one State ideology"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/node-js-v10-what-you-need-to-know/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Node.js v10 What you need to know"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"22050827-6a11-5cea-9aac-f16e97b048cf","previousPostId":"0464473a-7b67-549a-a876-9e196dd0583a","nextPostId":"bfa18bf1-33be-53b6-abad-bcf222ef7ff6","category":"devops"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
