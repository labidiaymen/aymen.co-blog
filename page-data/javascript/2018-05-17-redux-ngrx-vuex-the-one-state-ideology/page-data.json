It's hard when you start <strong>growing</strong> your app using these techniques.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered (forced myself to use) Redux or the one state manager, at the beginning I found myself writing more code than I usually do, creating the <strong>actions</strong>, the <strong>reducers</strong>, and the <strong>effects</strong> and so on.</p>\n<p>And to create an action I need to pass by <strong>many files</strong> to do a single <strong>interaction</strong>, it was like another hell, but when the app starts growing I didn't feel <em><strong>exhausted</strong></em> like before, when I wanna get some <strong>data</strong> I know <strong>exactly how and where to find it</strong>,  and also I can easily plug any other blocks into the apps I just need to connect it to the State manager and I get the access to all what I need, Isn't That cool?</p>\n<p>But wait I'm an <strong>Angular</strong> Developer and Redux made for the <strong>React</strong> Community, well there's an implementation of <strong>Redux</strong> philosophy for Angular folks and it calls <a href=\"https://github.com/ngrx\">NGRX</a> and I used it in production and everything seems <strong>alright</strong>.</p>\n<p>How about <strong>Vue.js</strong> developers? <a href=\"https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/\">Vuex</a> is the implementation of Redux for the Vue.js framework, I tried it and it does what I need.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Using a state Manager really helped me a lot and boost my skills and it reduced the development time.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Forced your self to use it and feel the difference.</p>\n<p>Did you try a State Manager <strong>before</strong>?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[Redux, NGRX, VUEX] The one State ideology","date":"May 17, 2018","description":null,"cover":"../images/the-state-id-aymen.co_-1.png"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-05-15-the-modern-ui-frameworks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Modern UI frameworks"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-05-19-devops-build-and-test-nativescript-project-with-gitlab-ci/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[DevOps] Build and Test  Nativescript Project with Gitlab-CI"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"00561f1e-66a5-5704-ba6e-ee86f22ff193","previousPostId":"fccb6abf-331a-597b-acbf-8d6263270cc4","nextPostId":"225dacd7-97bb-5b11-992e-1df67948e04e","category":"javascript"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
