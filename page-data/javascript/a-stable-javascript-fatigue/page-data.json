UI Library</a> )</p>\n<p>Then <strong>Angular.js</strong> has appeared at 2009, followed by <a href=\"https://knockoutjs.com/\">Knockout</a>, <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.js</a>, <a href=\"https://www.emberjs.com/\">Ember.js</a>, and others.</p>\n<p>After a while <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> has been <strong>introduced</strong> by <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a> at 2013, a <strong>component-based</strong> frontend framework</p>\n<p>Then in 2016, it comes <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular 2+</a> a complete Javascript framework for the front-end.</p>\n<p>But <strong>Ryan Dahl</strong> let the front-end developer be a full-stack developer by making <a href=\"https://goo.gl/1Y1wmg\">Node.js</a></p>\n<p>After 2009 developers start making <strong>web application and services</strong> with Javascript and new JavaScript frameworks start popups.</p>\n<p>Starting from 2017-2018 people start choosing a path to follow, like Angular developer, React Developer and so on.</p>\n<p>Also <strong>me</strong>, I’m known as Angular developer,  That’s the main framework that I work with but you need also to <strong>master</strong> other Frameworks if you want to be laways <strong>fresh</strong>.</p>\n<p>Following everything is the perfect option to lose <strong>focus</strong>. for me, I’m really aware of what I should <strong>consume</strong> to prevent the <strong>distraction</strong>, and also I create a routine to keep up with what should I know.</p>\n<p>Again have you felt the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/Hgnph7\">JavaScript fatigue</a> before?
