family members, so keeping the good <strong>relationship</strong> is the main thing you need to <strong>focus</strong> on.</p>\n<p>When everything goes right, everybody is happy, but when one thing goes wrong, not nesserely everybody should feel sad.</p>\n<p>To keep the good relationship we need to remove all the <strong>confusing</strong> things from the workflow and <strong>everybody should speak the same language</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let's pick a case that everybody will pass on :</p>\n<p>You create a view with <strong>Angular</strong>, Vue or React, you consumed mock services and everything looks OK,</p>\n<p>Then it comes the moment of truth when you will connect the frontend view with the backend service/<strong>API</strong>, you implemented it and it didn't work you will contact the backend developer and he will tell you that his service work like a charm.</p>\n<p>You invite him to look at the result and he admitted that there's a <strong>bug need to fix</strong>.</p>\n<p>After he fixes his code, two things can happen :</p>\n<p>The bug fixed and everything goes right.</p>\n<p>The bug persists and you show him the <strong>scenario</strong> again and we loop through this until we get everything OK, if we did not break other parts of the <strong>App</strong>.</p>\n<p>That's Ok but, this takes time and energy.</p>\n<p>Here's I start a searching for <strong>automation</strong>, then to end to end <strong>testing</strong>, to simulate everything, and here's my experience :</p>\n<p>I found <strong><a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\">Cypress</a></strong> and start writing my tests for my views and after each view or service <strong>implementation</strong>, then the worrying start decreasing.</p>\n<p>With the (<strong>e2e</strong>) end to end testing, you stop worrying about <strong>regression</strong> and focusing on the new <strong>functionalities</strong> that need to implement.</p>\n<p>With that, the relation between the front and back Team <strong>start recovering</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the <strong>test fails</strong> I made a video of the issue and send it the concerned person, <strong>otherwise</strong> I invite him to watch the scenario fails ?</p>\n<p>I start being less exhausted as a Front-end developer.</p>\n<p><strong>Next step</strong>, is to add the e2e test, to the <strong>DevOps</strong> pipeline.</p>\n<p>And you, how are you dealing with the <strong>regressions?</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cypress as Frontend
