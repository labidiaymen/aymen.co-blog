They <strong>react</strong> when something is done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's take an example from  Rx(Reactive-Extensions) : The **_combineLatest _**operator combine the latest expression is used to synchronize 2 <strong>Observable streams</strong> into single Observable stream.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Combine Latest</strong> doesn’t using queue, as it name suggest it only remember the latest value of each stream.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/reactive-programming-1.jpg\" alt=\"reactive-programming\"> We can see that when the <strong>y stream</strong> observed the <strong>b</strong> value, the **result stream **<strong>combine</strong> it with the <strong>latest</strong> value observed on <strong>x stream</strong> (3) and latter the same value will be <strong>combine</strong> into the result stream when the <strong>x stream</strong> will <strong>observed</strong> the <strong>4</strong> value.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Combine Latest</strong> processing will come to end either when one of the stream</p>\n<p>will <strong>complete</strong> or <strong>throw exception,</strong> in this case y Stream run <strong>complete</strong>(<strong>onComplete</strong> before <strong>RxJS5</strong>)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h2>Did you feel lost ?</h2>\n<p>I felt the same thing the first time i read about reactive programming and RxJS, the hardest part of the learning journey is <strong>thinking in Reactive</strong>. It's a lot about letting go of old imperative and stateful habits of typical programming, and forcing your brain to work in a different paradigm.</p>\n<p>What about you? it worth learning nowadays ?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have any corrections you can pull a request on GitHub : <a href=\"https://github.com/labidiaymen/aymen.co/blob/master/javascript/what-is-reactive-programming.md\">What is Reactive programming ? on GitHub</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is Reactive programming ?","date":"January 05, 2017","description":null,"categories":["javascript"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/e008e/reactive-programming-thumb-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/20979/reactive-programming-thumb-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/9aa69/reactive-programming-thumb-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/e008e/reactive-programming-thumb-1.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/c3e0e/reactive-programming-thumb-1.avif 100w,\n/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/c61ac/reactive-programming-thumb-1.avif 200w,\n/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/9870f/reactive-programming-thumb-1.avif 400w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/a1373/reactive-programming-thumb-1.webp 100w,\n/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/ac5e7/reactive-programming-thumb-1.webp 200w,\n/static/5b7da39b449c896653c0f035cc3c0ae9/a4d68/reactive-programming-thumb-1.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":309}}}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/start-your-angular-webapp/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Start your Angular WebApp"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-rxjs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is RxJS?"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"32e3c72b-490e-56f9-9300-c1f30700a3f4","previousPostId":"d0f1e2f3-774a-54d0-a06f-31023a36233e","nextPostId":"07d8898b-cb4d-5f00-a920-0a677e0daad1","category":"javascript"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
