Ionic has released Ionic 3, a new major version that means we will have incompatible API changes.

Let's take a look at what changes were introduced by Ionic Team :

- Ionic 3 shipped with latest version of Angular 4
- IonicPage Decorator, a new way to deep link your pages and add support to lazy loading
- Lazy Loading: This change affects the file structure and navigation of your application, but they will ultimately speed the application up

And you can start your app always with --v2 flag

ionic start ionic3App --v2
