Have you felt the [JavaScript fatigue](https://goo.gl/Hgnph7) before? **I have**.

Being a web developer using JavaScript **frameworks** consumes a lot of energy.

The JavaScript meant to be for the **front-end** development and to add some interaction to static pages, like display images on click, validate forms and load **async** portion of data.

Look around you now, JavaScript **is everywhere**. every month or a week there a new framework or library that want to change the world appears.

Let's look at some history:

At first, there's plain **JavaScript**, at that age, you need to write more for less, then it comes the libraries like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [MooTools](https://mootools.net/), and YUI( [Yahoo! UI Library](https://yuilibrary.com/) )

Then **Angular.js** has appeared at 2009, followed by [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/), [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/), and others.

After a while [React](https://reactjs.org/) has been **introduced** by [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/) at 2013, a **component-based** frontend framework

Then in 2016, it comes [Angular 2+](https://angular.io/) a complete Javascript framework for the front-end.

But **Ryan Dahl** let the front-end developer be a full-stack developer by making [Node.js](https://goo.gl/1Y1wmg)

After 2009 developers start making **web application and services** with Javascript and new JavaScript frameworks start popups.

Starting from 2017-2018 people start choosing a path to follow, like Angular developer, React Developer and so on.

Also **me**, I'm known as Angular developer,  That's the main framework that I work with but you need also to **master** other Frameworks if you want to be laways **fresh**.

Following everything is the perfect option to lose **focus**. for me, I'm really aware of what I should **consume** to prevent the **distraction**, and also I create a routine to keep up with what should I know.

Again have you felt the [JavaScript fatigue](https://goo.gl/Hgnph7) before? Share your **experience** with us ?.
