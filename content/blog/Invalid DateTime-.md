I start my career like the majority of the developers as a freelancer, and after a good amount of projects, I start building a Team, after that, I look forward and I started a Startup, Why? simply to put up the good culture that I didn't find in any company that I worked for.

After I start my consulting journey, I start working for companies in their office and manage my Team remotely, and It was very hard at first Then I get used to and everything goes right.

BUT and that's a big BUT, when you make a good culture at your Startup and you enter another culture, you need to adapt to their culture and it's been OK.

BUT, this another big BUT, how about if you start working with a very good and supportive CTO and a bad manager that trait the peoples working in his open space as machine working in specific hours, and make people fear of contacting him when seeking information. I've been OK  and I didn't have an issue communication with him.

Let's take a step back. I said a supportive CTO and a BAD manager.

For me, I always participate in the respectful conversation, other than that I cut off any direct conversion and ask the other parts to start a title thread with the subject and the CTO in it, here you can start a respectful conversation and start discussing the subject, like that you did get your respect and continue your challenge with the good CTO, because we can't find everything like we what, sometimes we need to adapt.

how about you? how you will manage this situation?
