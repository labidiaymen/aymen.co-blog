First of all i'm an Angular  developer, and i Like how Angular structure the project, especially the style guide by Team Angular,  So why NativeScript ?

With NativeScript

- You can take your Angular knowledge with you when you want to make a Mobile App
- The NativeScript community is growing each day (11,828 Star on github).
- You can use any JavaScript package from NPM ( [www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com)), like [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com).
- XML is much close to Angular HTML and you will get use to it.

Managing state in Angular become easy with [@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) (RxJS powered state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux) and you can take it with you to NativeScript.

Also, when you try to make a dashboard, webapp and mobile app, you can use the Same technology (Angular) and share 70% of your code between these platforms, and you reduce time and move our focus to the functionalities and the tests.
