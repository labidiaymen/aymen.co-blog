Have you visited a website and you got a suggestion to install a related app or official application and  you resist ?

**Things have been changed**

> A progressive Web-app uses modern web capabilities to deliver an App-like user experience.

Progressive web apps describe a collection of technologies design and concept, an web API that work together to provide  an app-like experience on the mobile web.

Let's start with the powerful technology behind the progressive web app (PWA)

 

## **Service Workers**

They power the basic of what a mobile app provide, like offline functionality, push notifications, background content caching and much more.

So how the service workers WORK ?

it's just a JavaScript code that run on background independent of the application and runs in response to events like network requests, push notifications, connectivity changes ...

Just like that.

 

## **App shell**

It's a  design concept whereby the initial load of a mobile web app provides a basic shell of a app UI, and the content for the app is loaded after, with this model we can improve the UX and the load time.

 

## **App Manifest**

"Manifest" this word it's not new for the android developer, how about this file (AndroidManifest.xml) Android developer ?

Yes you guess it, each install-able application need to tell the OS some info, in this case we need a manifest.json file and link it to the main HTML page (index.html) file to tell the browser that this Web-app is install-able

 

## **Conclusion**

Progressive Web Apps (WPA) are equal parts new Web APIs, design patterns, also they push to the web developer, by using the web technologies anywhere to make an app-like web-app.
