Have you been thinking to blow the world from the first days when you are trying to start a new project? Ok, let's get to the point, that's totally wrong. Normally, if you launch a new project and it has a good support you can make a good pitch at the first days, but after that is you that decide to make it greater or not, your project can't guide himself, you do that.

So **Be patient**
