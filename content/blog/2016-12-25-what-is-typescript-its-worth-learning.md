### **What is Typescript ?**

[**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a free and open-source programming language created by [**Anders Hejlsberg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg), the creator of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#, and maintained by [**Microsoft**](https://www.microsoft.com).

**TypeScript** isn’t a completely new language, it’s a superset of ES6. If we write ES6 code, it’s perfectly valid and compilable TypeScript code. Here’s a diagram that shows the relationship between the languages:

What is **ES5**? What is **ES6**? ES5 is short for **“[ECMAScript 5](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/)”**, otherwise known as “regular **Javascript**”. ES5 is the **normal Javascript**. It runs in more-or-less every browser. **ES6** is the **next** version of Javascript.

Also, we can mention that TypeScript is an official collaboration between **Microsoft** and **Google**

### **It's worth learning ?**

With two tech heavyweights ( **Microsoft** and **Google**) behind it we know that it will be supported for a long time. Both groups are committed to moving the web forward and as developers we win because of it.

Also [**Angular2**](https://angular.io/) is built in TypeScript and there are a lot of reasons to use TypeScript instead of plain Javascript

How do you think ? it's worth learning ?
