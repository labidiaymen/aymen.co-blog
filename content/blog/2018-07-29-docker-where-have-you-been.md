Euuh [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), I know you're here for a while, but this is the right time I took the courage and make the hole things work with you.

First of all, I'm a **consultant** and I have a **startup** which means I work on lots of things with a lot of **things**.

And to keep it up without loses I need to isolate each thing from the other things. and here's where I start using Docker.

I hear people talking about Docker on the [**DevOps**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) field but this is not the case for me, I start using Docker in the development environment, and here's how.

In the last mission, I was working on a frontend application using the [**Angular**](https://angular.io/) framework, and it's not just me, we were a team working on the same project trying the make things happen, really fast.

But this is not the case when we have a different version of Node.js and [**@angular/**](https://cli.angular.io/)cli.

This start occurring when building success in some machine and fail in other, and here we start using Docker in the development **environment**, we choose a Node.js version that matches with the production server and we create an image for the environment, then we all start using the same image.

Besides all of that, any **new member** can use the same image without installing any of other **tools** than Docker, and it makes the integration of new members easy and smooth.

Then I start controlling the **CPU** and the Memory of the container to keep the host machine cool and prevent battery drain when I'm walking around with my MacBook Pro

That does not **end** here.

I start exploring new applications that were hard to install especially when I was using **Windows**, but with Docker, I just need to **pull an image** and run it.

I use **Docker**, how about **you**?
